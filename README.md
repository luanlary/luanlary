## Who am I?


My name is Luan Lary. In the last two decades I have been working in different areas of technology. 

Although My degree is in Physics, I am a true enthusiast of software development and design. 

I worked with desktop development with low and high level languages since, Assemblyx86, C, C++ Pascal Object Pascal and C#. 
I also worked with Web development with PHP, Pearl, Asp.Net and Javascript since vanila to the great reactive frameorks, from the old ones to the top of hype. 

I worked as a Full-Stack, as a Front-end and currently work with the focus on Backend. 
I had the opportunity to design and maintain Monoliths MVC, MVVM in addition to procedural legacies. 

Today my focus is design and maintain microservices and distributed applications with Nosql databases and hexagonal architecture. 
Right now my new passions are Haskel and Go, but of course, I do not care about the tools, I like to create solutions.
